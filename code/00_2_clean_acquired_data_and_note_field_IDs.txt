## ABS/original_domain_analysis_data
The Victorian project made use of some previously analysed data; a copy of this and appropriate references was made here; and derived versions customised for project purposes were stored in the ABS_derived folder.

## ABS/ABS_derived
After cleaning the download files listed above, the derived directory should more or less correspond to the following.  The text files accompanying csv tables indicate source of derived data, and any relevant comments which were excerpted in order for data to be processed (e.g. that individual cell frequencies may have small random offset for anonymisation purposes):
